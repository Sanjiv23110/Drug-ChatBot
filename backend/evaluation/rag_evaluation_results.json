        "Page 3 of 20 \n \n \n  \nINDICATIONS AND CLINICAL USES \n \nCeeNU (lomustine-CCNU) is indicated as palliative therapy in addition to surgery and radiotherapy or in \ncombination therapy with other chemotherapeutic agents in the following: \n \n1. Brain tumors - both primary and metastatic, in patients who have already received appropriate surgical \nand/or radiotherapeutic procedures. \n \n2. Hodgkin's Disease \u2013 as a secondary therapy, alone or in combination with other active drugs. \n \nOther Tumors \u2013 CeeNU has been used in combination with other therapeutic agents in lung cancer \n(squamous cell, anaplastic large cell, and adenocarcinoma), malignant melanoma and breast cancer \n(advanced disease) only after other conventional methods have failed. \n \n CONTRAINDICATIONS \n \nCeeNU (lomustine-CCNU) should not be given to individuals who have demonstrated a previous \nhypersensitivity to it.  Also it is contraindicated in patients having severe leukopenia and/or \nthrombocytopenia. \n \n WARNINGS \n \nCeeNU (lomustine-CCNU) should be administered by individuals experienced in the use of antineoplastic \ntherapy.",

At the recommended dosage, courses of CeeNU should not be given more frequently than \nevery 6 weeks.",
        "Page 5 of 20 \n \nPregnancy \nSafe use in pregnancy has not been established.  CeeNU is embryotoxic and teratogenic in rats and \nembryotoxic in rabbits at dose levels equivalent to the human dose.  If this drug is used during pregnancy, \nor if the patient becomes pregnant while taking (receiving) this drug, the patients should be apprised of \nthe potential hazard to the fetus.  Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming \npregnant. \n \nNursing Mothers \nDue to the lipophilic nature of CeeNU, it is likely to be excreted in breast milk. As a risk to the nursing \nchild exists, a decision should be made whether to discontinue breastfeeding or t o discontinue CeeNU \ntherapy. \n \n PRECAUTIONS \n \nDue to delayed bone marrow suppression, blood counts should be monitored weekly for at least six weeks \nafter a dose. \n \nBaseline pulmonary function studies should be conducted along with frequent pulmonary function tests \nduring treatment.  Patients with a baseline below 70% of the predicted Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) or \nCarbon Monoxide Diffusing Capacity (DLco) are particularly at risk.",

Gastrointestinal:  Nausea and vomiting may occur 3 to 6 hours after an oral dose and usually lasts less \nthan 24 hours.  The frequency and duration may be reduced by the use of antiemetics prior to dosing \nand by the administration of CeeNU (lomustine-CCNU) to fasting patients. \n \n2. Hematologic Toxicity:  The most frequent and most serious toxicity of CeeNU is delayed \nmyelosuppression.  It usually occurs four to six weeks after drug administration and is dose related.  \nThrombocytopenia occurs at about four weeks post-administration and persists for one to two weeks.  \nLeukopenia occurs at five to six weeks after a dose of CeeNU and persists for one to two weeks.   \n \nApproximately 65% of patients receiving 130 mg/m2 develop white blood counts below 5000 /mm3.  \nThirty-six percent developed white blood cell counts below 3000 /mm3.

Other Toxicities:  Stomatitis, alopecia, anemia have been reported infrequently. \n \nNeurological reactions such as disorientation, lethargy, ataxia and dysarthria have been noted in some \npatients receiving CeeNU.  However, the relationship to medication in these patients is unclear. \n \n5. Nephrotoxicity:  Renal abnormalities consisting of decrease in kidney size, progressive azotemia and \nrenal failure have been reported in patients who receive large cumulative doses after prolonged \ntherapy with CeeNU and related nitrosoureas.  Kidney damage has also been reported occasionally in \npatients receiving lower total doses. \n \n6. Hepatotoxicity:  A reversible type of hepatic toxicity, manifested by increased transaminase, alkaline \nphosphatase and bilirubin levels, has been reported in a small percentage of patients receiving CeeNU.",
        "Page 4 of 20 \n \nThe bone marrow toxicity of CeeNU is cumulative and therefore dosage adjustment must be considered \non the basis of nadir blood counts from prior dose (see Dosage Adjustment Table under DOSAGE AND \nADMINISTRATION). \n \nCaution should be used in administering CeeNU to patients with decreased circulating platelets, \nleukocytes or erythrocytes (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). \n \nPulmonary toxicity including pulmonary infiltration and fibrosis (often fatal) from CeeNU appears to be \ndose related (see ADVERSE REACTIONS). \n \n \nLiver and renal function tests should be monitored periodically (see ADVERSE REACTIONS). \n \nConcomitant use of CeeNU with a live virus vaccine may potentiate the replication of the vaccine virus \nand/or may increase the adverse reaction of the vaccine virus because normal defense mechanisms may \nbe suppressed by CeeNU. Vaccination with a live vaccine in a patient taking CeeNU may result in severe \ninfection. Patient\u2019s antibody response to vaccines may be decreased. The use of live vaccines should be \navoided and individual specialist advice sought (see PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions). \n \n \nCarcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility",

Long-term use of nitrosoureas has been reported to \nbe possibly associated with the development of secondary malignancies. The occurrence of acute \nleukemia and bone marrow dysplasias has been reported in patients following nitrosourea therapy. \n \nCeeNU can have a mutagenic effect. Men treated with CeeNU are therefore advised not to father children \nduring treatment and for up to 6 months afterwards, and to seek advice regarding sperm conservation \nbefore the start of treatment given the possibility of irreversible infertility caused by CeeNU therapy. \nCeeNU also affects fertility in male rats at doses somewhat higher than the human dose.",
